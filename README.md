# TicTacToe

> The TicTacToe game is a popular game, commonly know as notts and crosses where players take turn to mark 'Xs' and 'Os' on a 3 * 3 grid.

![Game Intro](game_start.png)

This whole TicTacToe game is built in Ruby. The main intent for building it was to demonstrate an understanding of Object Oriented Programming(OOP) in Ruby. It consists of the following:
- A `Player` class that's reponsible for the creation of player objects that will be utilized within the program.
- A `GameBoard` class that has various methods such as one to check if the move made is a valid move, another to check if the board is filled and another to check for the winner.
- It also has a `main.rb` file that's responsible for user interaction.
